shortDescription: '    Cyberization is all pervasive today with technology-driven engineering systems having a significant presence in almost all spheres of life. In fact, with each passing year, they are evolving at a very fast pace in terms of AI, computational capacities, and their scope of use.
    <br/><br/>
    While they offer numerous benefits to society on one hand, the current state of cyberization is creating an intellectual challenge to envision, design, and research Human-Centered Systems for the future. Since human-centered systems integrate CPS with various social units â€“ organizations, communities, and distinctive social processes and practices; our lab envisions meeting the research challenges of making them more usable and sustainable.
